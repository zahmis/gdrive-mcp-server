## 🔧 Usage

### As a Command Line Tool

```bash
# Start the server
node dist/index.js
```

### Integration with Desktop App

Add this configuration to your app's server settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/gdrive-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "path/to/gdrive-mcp-server/credentials/gcp-oauth.keys.json",
